# Will Malt be ported to Vulkan?

The most likely replacement for *OpenGL* in *Malt* is WebGPU Native, since it's easier to use than *Vulkan* and has better *MacOS* support.

Not at the moment.    
Malt main focus is animation and illustration and it prioritizes flexibility and image quality, which usually comes at a performance cost.
